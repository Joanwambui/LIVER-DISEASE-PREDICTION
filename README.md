# LIVER-DISEASE-PREDICTION
Predict if a Patient has Liver Disease or not

Patients with liver disease have been continuously increasing because of excessive consumption of alcohol, inhale of harmful gases, intake of contaminated food, pickles and drugs. In an effort to reduce the burden on doctors,we build a predictive machine learning that would give an indication of whether a person would have a liver problem or not.

The goal is to build a logistic machine learning model that predicts whether a patient is healthy (non-liver patient) or ill (liver patient) based on some clinical and demographic features (or input variables) listed in the dataset provided.
